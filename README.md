### Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse 
This project demonstrates the foundational steps involved in creating and working with a Data Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric. It follows a hands-on lab exercise that introduces core features such as workspace setup, data modeling, query execution, and reporting using the built-in tools within Fabric.

### Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

Create a workspace with Microsoft Fabric trial.

Build and manage a data warehouse.

Define dimension and fact tables in a relational model.

Model relationships between tables.

Run analytical queries using SQL.

Create views to encapsulate reusable logic.

Use the visual query editor for no-code data exploration.

Build a basic Power BI report on top of the warehouse data.

### Lab Steps
1. Create a Workspace
Set up a new workspace in Microsoft Fabric with trial or premium capacity enabled.

2. Create a Data Warehouse
Launch a new data warehouse instance from the Fabric interface.

3. Create Tables and Insert Data
Use the T-SQL editor to define dimension and fact tables, and populate them with sample data.

4. Define a Data Model
Visually map relationships (many-to-one) between fact and dimension tables using key columns.

5. Query Warehouse Tables
Execute SQL queries to aggregate and analyze data across the model using JOIN and GROUP BY clauses.

6. Create a View
Encapsulate reusable SQL logic by creating a view based on your queries.

7. Visual Query Designer
Explore your data without writing SQL by using the no-code visual query interface.

8. Visualize Your Data
Hide unnecessary columns and use the Power BI reporting interface to build a visual report summarizing key metrics, such as sales by category.

9. Clean Up Resources
Optionally remove the workspace to clean up resources after completing the exercise.

### Requirements
Access to a Microsoft Fabric trial or licensed account.

Web browser access to Microsoft Fabric.

### Outcome
This lab provides a comprehensive introduction to building and querying a data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric, with an emphasis on SQL analytics and visualization. It is ideal for data analysts, BI developers, and anyone exploring Microsoft Fabricâ€™s unified analytics capabilities.
